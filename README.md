# Experience

A PyTorch extension that replaces numeric matrix multiplication with **LLM-powered text computation** inside neural network training loops. Each tensor element stores arbitrary text (code, translations, etc.) in files on disk, while numeric coefficients flow through standard autograd. An ExperienceTensor — a key-value store shaped as `[N, 3]` — serves as the learnable "weight" of the model, starting empty and being built up entirely by a patch-based optimizer across training iterations. The LLM acts as the compute kernel: during forward pass it reads experience entries to produce outputs; during backward pass it computes diffs; during the optimizer step `patch` applies diffs to experience entries incrementally.

The result is a model that can **learn to perform tasks it was never trained on** by accumulating experience at runtime, demonstrated by translating Python into Viba — a novel DSL that does not exist in the training corpus of any existing LLM.

## Dual-Channel Gradient System

Gradients propagate through two channels simultaneously:

| Channel | What it carries | How it's computed |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Numeric** (coefficient) | Float values (bfloat16) | Standard autograd / SGD arithmetic |
| **Symbolic** (text) | Unified diffs stored in files | LLM computes `diff -u` between actual and expected |

The `symbolic_grad_registry` (thread-local dictionary) passes symbolic gradient metadata between autograd Function backward calls, since PyTorch autograd strips custom tensor attributes (`st_relative_to`, `st_tensor_uid`) when propagating gradients between Function nodes.

## LLM Backends

Two backends are supported:

### `raw_llm_api` (default)
OpenAI-compatible API (`LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`). Packs directory contents into a prompt, finds files containing the TODO placeholder, and replaces them with LLM responses. Lightweight, no tool access.

### `coding_agent`
Claude Agent SDK with `Read`, `Edit`, `Write` tool access. The agent can directly read and modify files in the workspace. Best for complex tasks requiring file system interaction.

Both are dispatched through `TaskHandler`, which takes `AgentTask` objects and runs them concurrently via `asyncio.gather`.

## ExperienceTensor

An **ExperienceTensor** is a symbolic tensor of shape `[N, 3]` where each row is a `(query, key, value)` triple:
- **Query** (position 0): Semantic keywords (one per line) used for Jaccard similarity retrieval
- **Key** (position 1): Source domain content (e.g., Python code)
- **Value** (position 2): Target domain content (e.g., code in another language)

It acts as the learnable "weight" of the model — starts empty and is populated during training. The backward pass computes diffs against expected output, and the optimizer applies patches to experience entries via `patch`.

## Demo: Python to Viba Translation

This example trains a model from scratch to translate Python code into **Viba** — a novel domain-specific language invented for this project that does not exist in the training corpus of any existing LLM. The LLM must learn to generate syntactically and semantically correct code in a language it has never seen, purely from the experience entries built up during training.

### Why Viba?

Existing LLMs have been trained on billions of lines of Python, JavaScript, Haskell, etc. Translating between these tests whether the model can *recall* patterns from pre-training. Viba eliminates this confound — any correct translation demonstrates genuine *generalization* driven by the experience mechanism.

Viba is an algebraic data type (ADT) definition language with these core constructs:

```viba
name := <type_expr>                     # type/function definition
<type_expr> := <binding> ...            # sequence of bindings
$var <type>                             # typed variable declaration
<- $var <type>                          # input binding (argument)
<- $expr                                # return binding (result)
# inline                                # inline expansion hint
```

Type expressions use four ADT combinators:

| Combinator | Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Sum | `\|` | Tagged union (branching) | `\| 'positive' \| 'zero' \| 'negative'` |
| Product | adjacency / `*` | Tuple composition | `str * int` |
| Exponent | `<-` | Function type | `int <- int` (unary), `str <- int <- float` (curried) |
| Tag | `` ` `` | Type-level tag/annotation | `` `JSON`` |

Pattern matching replaces control flow:

```viba
Match[$x > 0 -> 'positive', $x == 0 -> 'zero', _ -> 'negative']
```

Generics and collection types:

```viba
list[$elem int]           # parametric list
dict['first' = $a, 'second' = $b]   # dict literal
(int <- int)              # function type as value
```

### 1. Dataset

12 Python-to-Viba translation pairs covering fundamental patterns:

| Pattern | Python | Viba |
|---------|--------|------|
| Sequential | `seq.py` | `seq.viba` |
| Branching | `branch.py` | `branch.viba` |
| Loop | `loop.py` | `loop.viba` |
| Recursion | `recursion.py` | `recursion.viba` |
| Higher-order | `higher_order.py` | `higher_order.viba` |
| Data structures | `data_struct.py` | `data_struct.viba` |
| Default args | `default_arg.py` | `default_arg.viba` |
| List comprehension | `list_comp.py` | `list_comp.viba` |
| String formatting | `format_str.py` | `format_str.viba` |
| Guard clauses | `guard.py` | `guard.viba` |
| Accumulator | `accumulator.py` | `accumulator.viba` |
| Closure | `closure.py` | `closure.viba` |

### 2. Setup

```python
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

from experience.symbolic_tensor.tensor_util.make_tensor import make_tensor
from experience.symbolic_tensor.function.get_edit_distance_ratio import get_edit_distance_ratio
from experience.symbolic_tensor.optimizer.st_sgd import StSGD
from experience.example.naive_symbolic_transform_model.model import NaiveModel

DATASET_PAIRS = [
    "seq", "branch", "loop",
    "recursion", "higher_order", "data_struct",
    "default_arg", "list_comp", "format_str",
    "guard", "accumulator", "closure",
]
```

### 3. Build Tensors

```python
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    # Input: symlinks to Python source files
    py_paths = [Path("dataset") / f"{name}.py" for name in DATASET_PAIRS]
    input_tensor = make_tensor(py_paths, tmpdir, symlink=True)

    # Expected: Viba code as strings
    viba_contents = [(Path("dataset") / f"{name}.viba").read_text() for name in DATASET_PAIRS]
    expected_tensor = make_tensor(viba_contents, tmpdir)

    # Experience: starts EMPTY — learned during training
    n = len(DATASET_PAIRS)
    experience_tensor = make_tensor([[""] * 3 for _ in range(n)], tmpdir)
```

### 4. Training Loop

```python
    model = NaiveModel(task_prompt="Translate Python To Viba", topk=1)
    model.load_experience(experience_tensor)
    optimizer = StSGD(model.parameters(), lr=1.0)

    for iteration in range(1, 6):
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward: LLM translates each Python file to Viba using experience
        output, selected_indexes = model(input_tensor)

        # Loss: Levenshtein edit distance ratio
        loss = get_edit_distance_ratio(output, expected_tensor)
        mean_loss = loss.mean().item()
        print(f"Iteration {iteration} loss: {mean_loss:.4f}")

        # Backward: computes symbolic gradients (diffs) via autograd
        loss.mean().backward()

        # Optimizer step: applies patches to experience via patch
        optimizer.step()
```

### 5. Run

```bash
python -m experience.example.naive_symbolic_transform_model.train
```

### 6. Results (5 iterations, 12 pairs)

Loss trajectory: `['0.6641', '0.5469', '0.4668', '0.4473', '0.4219']` — **converges** (36.5% reduction).

```
Dataset: 12 pairs
Experience: [24, 3]   # 24 entries (2x dataset size for exploration headroom)

Iteration 1/5  Mean loss: 0.6641
  output[0]: 'fun greet(name: str) -> str:\n    let greeting = "Hello"...'        # random language
  output[1]: 'func classify(x: int) -> str:\n    if x > 0:...'                  # Python-like
  Patches: applied=18 rejected=0 fuzzed=0 skipped=0

Iteration 3/5  Mean loss: 0.4668
  output[0]: 'greet :=\n    $message str\n    <- $name str\n    ...'              # Viba syntax!
  output[5]: 'make_pair :=\n    dict\n    <- $a str\n    <- $b str\n    ...'    # Viba syntax!
  Patches: applied=6 rejected=0 fuzzed=0 skipped=0

Iteration 5/5  Mean loss: 0.4219
  output[1]: "classify :=\n    | 'positive'\n    | 'zero'\n    | 'negative'..."  # exact Viba
  output[3]: 'factorial :=\n    <- $n int\n    # recursive\n    <- Match[...]'   # exact Viba
  output[11]: 'make_adder :=\n    $adder (int <- int)\n    <- $x int\n    ...'    # exact Viba

Patch stats (all 5 iterations): 34/34 applied, 0 rejected, 100% success rate.
```

Key observations:
- The model **starts with no Viba knowledge** — iteration 1 outputs are in random languages (Go, Rust, TypeScript-like).
- By iteration 3, the LLM begins using Viba syntax (`<-`, `$var`, `:=`) for some outputs.
- By iteration 5, several outputs match expected Viba code exactly (loss < 0.01 for branch, closure, guard).
- Experience entries accumulate correct Python-to-Viba mappings during training — e.g., entry `[22,23]` stores `classify(x) -> classify := | 'positive' | ...`.
- All 34 patches applied cleanly with 0% rejection rate across 5 iterations.

## How It Works

### Storage Layout

```
{relative_to}/{tensor_uid}/
├── shape                    # JSON: [2, 3]
├── storage/
│   ├── 0/data               # Element at flat index 0
│   ├── 1/data               # Element at flat index 1
│   └── 1/1/data             # Multi-digit index 11
```

### Forward Pass (`st_moe_forward`)

1. **Query Generation**: LLM extracts semantic keywords from each input element
2. **Experience Retrieval**: Jaccard similarity selects top-k relevant experience entries
3. **Context Assembly**: Dump symlink views of experience and input
4. **Task Dispatch**: `TaskHandler` dispatches `AgentTask` objects to the LLM backend
5. **Copy-back**: Results propagate through symlinks to parent storage

### Backward Pass (`st_moe_backward`)

Computes gradients for both **input** and **experience** through numeric + symbolic channels.

**Grad Input** (per element): Numeric is a pass-through (`grad_input.data = grad_output.data`). Symbolically, the LLM reads grad_output diffs alongside original input/output/experience and writes improved input files — the diff becomes the symbolic gradient.

**Grad Experience** (aggregated): The forward pass index list is transposed to group by experience entry (identifying which entries were used and by how many inputs). Cold-start padding randomly samples empty experience entries so they still receive gradients. The backward runs twice — once for key, once for value — with domain-specific prompts. The LLM merges multiple grad_output signals and writes improved experience files. Numerically, `grad_experience.data` scatter-adds `1.0` per usage count.

### Optimizer (`StSGD`)

Two-channel update per step:
- **Numeric**: `param.data = (1 - lr) * param.data + lr * grad.data`
- **Symbolic**: Applies unified diff patches from grad storage to param storage via `patch_tensor` (uses the `patch` CLI with fuzz=3). Only patches elements where `grad.data != 0` (key+value dims).
- **Query auto-update**: After patching key+value, derives query content by running `get_query_tensor` on the updated kv, merging LLM-generated keywords, sorting and deduplicating.

## Key Design Decisions

- **LLM as compute kernel**: Replaces matrix multiplication with semantic reasoning
- **Patch-based optimizer**: `diff`/`patch` for efficient incremental experience updates
- **Two LLM backends**: `raw_llm_api` (default, lightweight) and `coding_agent` (tool access)
- **Symlinks for views, copies for mutations**: Shared storage for context, independent copies for LLM writes
- **Experience starts empty**: Learned entirely at runtime, not pre-seeded
